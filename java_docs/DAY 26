/*
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine =0.
If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, fine= 50 * no of days after .
If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the  fine =500 * no of month after.
If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000.
